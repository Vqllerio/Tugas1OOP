Environment Setup Report
IDE = Visual Studio Code
Using Java Version 23.0.2

I directly installed the JVM, JDK, and JRE from a Visual Studio Code Extension Packet, the process was quick and smooth.

What i did:
I used ANSI Shadow for the welcome message and then set it to have the text color red and background color red
I thought about making an interactive CLI with a stickman talking to the user, but it proves to be pretty hard so i opted to just making an animation that shows a stickman greeting the user and telling a fun fact, and the name of the user was asked before the animation starts.
In the animation i didn't clear the whole terminal, i only did it at the start, I set the cursor to the first position (top left) and then rewriting every character each frame of the animation. Clearing the program causes a little lag that makes the animation choppy, hence why i opted to rewriting each character instead.

Things i learned along the process: 
I learned a couple basic syntax.
I learnd unicodes for styling the texts in java
I learned we could just do "git remote add origin (url)" to set the repo destination as the github url and add it to the repo
